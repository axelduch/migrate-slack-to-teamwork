Using client-oauth2 for oAuth2 client authentication, I picked it amongst several ones candidates were:
node-oauth -> Seemed mature, had a lot of contributions, last active was nov 2015, on the other hand it seemed not so robust concerning oAuth2
simple-oauth2 -> Seemed okay but I was not sure I could rely on it, or if it was robust enough
client-oauth2 -> Straight forward api, chainable requests

EDIT:
    I remembered of passport for authentication, and found a slack strategy. It is the simplest and most robust api I have found so far.


Using express for routing and serving static files
Using request-promise (provided by bluebird) to handle external api calls
