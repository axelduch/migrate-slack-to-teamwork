Using client-oauth2 for oAuth2 client authentication, I picked it amongst several ones candidates were:
node-oauth -> Seemed mature, had a lot of contributions, last active was nov 2015, on the other hand it seemed not so robust concerning oAuth2
simple-oauth2 -> Seemed okay but I was not sure I could rely on it, or if it was robust enough
client-oauth2 -> Straight forward api, chainable requests

Using express for routing and serving static files
